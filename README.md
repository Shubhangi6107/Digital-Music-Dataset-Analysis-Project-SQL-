## Project Objective

In this Digital Music Dataset Analysis Project, I explore the intricacies of a music playlist database using SQL. This project aims to provide insights into the music store's operations and contribute to an understanding of its business growth. By answering key questions using SQL, we delve into the dataset, uncover patterns, and draw valuable conclusions.

## Data Sources

Our primary dataset is the "music store" data file, encompassing records of albums, customers, employees, invoices, media types, playlists, tracks, artists, and more.

## Database and Tools

1. **PostgreSQL:** The robust relational database management system.
2. **PgAdmin4:** The feature-rich administration and development platform for PostgreSQL.

## Question Set to be Answered through SQL Project

1. **Senior Most Employee Based on Job Title:**
   - Query to identify the senior-most employee based on job title.

2. **Countries with the Most Invoices:**
   - Query to determine the countries with the highest number of invoices.

3. **Top 3 Values of Total Invoice:**
   - Query to extract the top 3 values of total invoices.

4. **City with the Best Customers:**
